# Max Ruther's Portfolio
Welcome to my data portfolio! Here I document a summary of my projects.
<br></br>

| Project | Tools | Skills Involved | Project Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/HCP_Fraud_Detection'>**Healthcare Provider Claim Fraud Detection**</a> | Python, Colab | Data Integration, Feature Engineering, Correlation-Based Feature Selection, Oversampling, Exploratory Visualization, Ensemble Learning | I implement several techniques from consulted literature to build an optimally precise classifier of healthcare providers' potential fraudulence. |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/Movie-List-Madness/tree/master/movielist_ingestion'>**Movie List Ingestor**</a> | Python, SQL/MySQL, Evernote | HTML-Parsing, Data Validation, Defining SQL Procedures, Database Building, Database Management | I parse an HTML version of my movie list and load the data into a local MySQL database. Once loaded, that data then populates three newly created MySQL tables, through predefined MySQL procedures. |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/Movie-List-Madness/tree/master/omdb_builder'>**Movie Database Enrichment - Incorporating an External Database**</a> | Python, SQL | JSON-Parsing, HTML Requests, Database Management | I enrich my movie list database by drawing from an external, open source one: _The Open Movie Database (OMDb)_. So afforded, I create three new tables in the MySQL database: *OMDb*, *Genres*, and *Critic_Ratings*. |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/Movie-List-Madness/tree/master/RatingsTableMender'>**Movie Database Integrity Improvement: Critical Review Data**</a> | Python, SQL | Handling Missing Values, Data Validation, Database Management | I remedy and supplement the review score data just retrieved from OMDb (as was done in the phase preceding.) These processes, which comprise the critic_ratings.RatingsTableMender package, largely involve remapping missing values and joining in review scores from an additional external source. |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/Movie-List-Madness/tree/master/critic_ratings/scrapers'>**Movie Database Enrichment II - Web-Scraping Additional Reviewers**</a> | Python | Web-Scraping, HTML & CSS Parsing, Web Crawling, Automated Search and Relevance Assessment  | I gather ratings and more from additional reviewers by creating various webscrapers, mainly for *Metacritic* and *Letterboxd*. |
| <a href='https://github.com/maxruther/Movie-List-Madness/tree/master/critic_ratings/scrapers'>**Movie Showtimes - Indie Fandango**</a> | Python, Google Calendar | Web-Scraping, HTML & CSS Parsing, Web Crawling, Automated Search and Relevance Assessment, Automated Scheduling  | I scrape showtimes from the pages of independent movie theaters in Chicago, then schedule them in Google Calendars. |
